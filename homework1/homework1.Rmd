## Question1

### (a)
Let $A$ be the event that the lower face of the coin is a head,
$$\Pr(A)=\frac{2\cdot2+2}{2\cdot5}=\frac{3}{5}.$$

### (b)
Let $A$ be the event that the lower face of the coin is a head, $B$ be the event that the coin is showing heads,
<!-- $$\Pr(A\mid B)=\frac{\Pr(B\mid A)\Pr(A)}{\Pr(B)}=\frac{2/4\cdot0.6}{0.6}=0.5.$$ -->
$$\Pr(A\mid B)=\frac{2\cdot2}{2\cdot2+2}=\frac{2}{3}.$$

### (c)
Let $A$ be the event that the lower face of the coin is a head,
$$\Pr(A\mid B)=\frac{4\cdot2}{4\cdot2+2}=\frac{4}{5}.$$
